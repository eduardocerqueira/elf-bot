# elf the bot

elf the bot is a slack-app built to interact with 3rd-party systems as JIRA, Openstack and Openshift to assist 
engineers with basic tasks and making the work-day a bit more fun!

status: elf is on very begin of implementation phase, might not be fully functional yet, but even that you still want to 
try, use with your own risk and there is no guarantee!
